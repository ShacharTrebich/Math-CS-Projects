This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualization tool built using Python with the pygame library. 
It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how different algorithms sort data step-by-step. 
The tool includes visualizations for insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, shaker sort, and selection sort. 
It offers adjustable sorting order (ascending/descending) with easy controls, allowing users to see real-time animation of block movements. 
The user interface is user-friendly, featuring descriptive labels and controls for easy interaction. The project supports dynamic list generation with customizable list size and value range. 
Additionally, it integrates audio feedback for start, finish, and step-by-step transitions in sorting.
